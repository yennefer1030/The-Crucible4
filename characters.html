    <h2>John Proctor</h2>
    <p>A local farmer who lives just outside town; Elizabeth Proctor’s husband. A stern, harsh-tongued man, John hates hypocrisy. Nevertheless, he has a hidden sin—his affair with Abigail Williams—that proves his downfall. When the hysteria begins, he hesitates to expose Abigail as a fraud because he worries that his secret will be revealed and his good name ruined.

    <h2>Abagail Williams</h2>
    <p>Reverend Parris’s niece. Abigail was once the servant for the Proctor household, but Elizabeth Proctor fired her after she discovered that Abigail was having an affair with her husband, John Proctor. Abigail is smart, wily, a good liar, and vindictive when crossed. (The Crucible: Character List, SparkNotes, https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/crucible!/characters/)</p>

    <h2>Reverand John Hale</h2>
    <p>A young minister reputed to be an expert on witchcraft. Reverend Hale is called in to Salem to examine Parris’s daughter Betty. Hale is a committed Christian and hater of witchcraft. His critical mind and intelligence save him from falling into blind fervor. His arrival sets the hysteria in motion, although he later regrets his actions and attempts to save the lives of those accused.

    <h2>Reverand Parris</h2>
    <p>The minister of Salem’s church. Reverend Parris is a paranoid, power-hungry, yet oddly self-pitying figure.
