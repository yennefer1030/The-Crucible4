    <p>The Crucible is a 4 act play that examins the Salem 
    witch trial that took place in 1692. The author of The Crucible wrote about people who existed in real life
    and went throught the witch tials while adding his own twist
    to their story. The play is divided into 4 Acts.</p>

    <h2>Act 1-</h2>"Ten-year-old Betty Parris has contracted a mysterious illness that renders her mute and bedridden. Her father, Reverend Parris, caught her dancing in the woods the night before with a group of girls. The group included his teenage niece, Abigail Williams, and his slave, Tituba. Rumors have spread around town that witchcraft is the cause of Betty’s illness, and people are now gathered at the Parris household. Parris questions Abigail about the rumors, but she claims the girls were just dancing. Ann Putnam says that her daughter, Ruth, who was with the group in the woods, is also afflicted with a strange illness. All of Ann’s children except Ruth have died as infants. Ann sent Ruth to Tituba in hopes that she would be able to communicate with her siblings and find out who or what was responsible for their deaths. To her uncle's dismay, Abigail admits that Tituba and Ruth were conjuring spirits in the woods.
Abigail and two girls named Mercy Lewis and Mary Warren, who were also in the woods, are left alone with Betty. They try to wake her up as they get their story straight. Betty blurts out that Abigail drank chicken blood in an attempt to cast a spell that would kill Elizabeth Proctor, and Abigail warns her to keep quiet (or else). John Proctor enters the room, and Mercy and Mary leave Abigail alone with him. John and Abigail had an affair when Abigail worked as a servant in his house, and Abigail wants it to continue. John insists that he has recommitted himself to his wife, Elizabeth. Betty whimpers when she hears the Lord’s name in a psalm that people are singing outside the room. Everyone who is singing outside the room rushes in to check on her. Betty's distress is taken as additional evidence of witchcraft by Ann Putnam, and some of the others start to come around to this theory as well.
An intellectual church leader named Reverend Hale arrives from the town of Beverly to investigate the situation and see if he can detect any signs of witchcraft. Abigail confesses that Tituba called the Devil after more details about the previous night are revealed. Tituba isn’t allowed to tell her side of the story (that Abigail was actually the instigator), and when she is threatened with hanging she confesses that she’s been forced to work for the Devil. She also names Sarah Good and Sarah Osburn as fellow witches after prompting by Parris and Hale. Abigail and Betty then admit their unwilling involvement in witchcraft and shout out the names of several other women who they claim to have seen with the Devil."

    <h2>Act 2-</h2>"John and Elizabeth discuss the trials in Salem, and they both realize things are getting out of hand (though John still believes the court would never actually hang anyone). Elizabeth tells John he has to go into town and inform them that Abigail is lying. John's hesitance leads to an argument rooted in his affair and the lack of trust that continues to pervade their marriage.
Mary Warren, who went to Salem to testify against the Proctors' wishes, returns to the house and gives Elizabeth a poppet (doll) she made in court. Mary reveals that Elizabeth was accused in court, but she spoke up in her defense. It's clear that Abigail is accusing Elizabeth because she hopes to take her place as John Proctor's wife. This leads to another argument where Elizabeth urges John to tell Abigail that there's absolutely no possibility of them ever being together.
Hale arrives and questions the Proctors about their religious devotion based on the accusations levied against Elizabeth. John tells him that the girls are frauds, and Hale actually starts to doubt the validity of the accusers' claims. Giles Corey and Francis Nurse come to the house in distress, revealing that both of their wives have been arrested for witchcraft. Then, Ezekiel Cheever and Marshal Herrick arrive with a warrant for Elizabeth's arrest. They find the doll that Mary gave her and notice that it has a needle stuck in it. This matches up with the "attack" on Abigail allegedly perpetrated by Elizabeth's spirit.
Proctor gets Mary to tell the truth about the doll. She says that she made it in court and stuck the needle in herself with Abigail sitting right next to her. However, the authorities are not convinced by this story. Proctor tears up the arrest warrant in frustration, but Elizabeth agrees to go peacefully.
When everyone else has left, Proctor tells Mary that she must testify on Elizabeth's behalf in court. Mary is terrified to do this because she knows that Abigail will turn the rest of the court against her. Proctor begins to feel a sort of relief because he senses that he and all the other hypocrites are finally being punished for their sins."

    <h2>Act 3-</h2>"Judge Hathorne is questioning Martha Corey off-stage. Giles Corey interrupts the proceedings to defend his wife, and he is dragged into a room off of the court (on stage) by Marshal Herrick. They are accompanied by Judge Hathorne, Governor Danforth, Reverend Parris and Reverend Hale, Francis Nurse, and Ezekiel Cheever.After a short discussion where the truth of the accusers’ claims is disputed by Francis Nurse and Giles Corey, Mary Warren and John Proctor enter the room. Mary admits to Danforth that she and the other girls were faking the whole time. Danforth is not convinced that this is the truth based on the evidence of witchcraft he's seen in court (people being choked by familiar spirits and slashed with daggers).
Proctor presents a petition signed by 91 people who are willing to vouch for the good character of Elizabeth Proctor, Rebecca Nurse, and Martha Corey. Danforth orders warrants drawn up for all the people who signed the petition. Proctor then presents a statement from Giles Corey where Corey testifies that Thomas Putnam encouraged his daughter, Ruth Putnam, to make accusations against George Jacobs so Putnam could snatch up Jacobs’ land. However, Giles refuses to reveal who gave him this information, so he is arrested for contempt of court and his accusations are dismissed.
Finally, Proctor gives Danforth Mary Warren’s statement where she admits in writing that she and the other girls were faking. The girls are brought in from the courtroom for questioning by Danforth. Abigail denies Mary’s accusations. The judges doubt Mary even more when she is unable to pretend to faint like she says she did in the courtroom. Abigail then says she feels a spirit in the room, which enrages Proctor. He calls her a whore and admits that they had an affair so that she will be discredited. Danforth brings Elizabeth Proctor in for questioning on this issue, but she covers up the affair to protect John’s reputation. She is unaware that he has already confessed. John’s accusations are subsequently dismissed.
Abigail claims to see a bird on the rafters that she insists is Mary Warren’s spirit poised to attack her. The other girls follow Abigail’s lead and gang up on Mary. A terrified Mary breaks down under the pressure of these accusations and confesses that John forced her to work for the Devil. Proctor and Corey are arrested, and Hale quits the court in disgust at this blatant display of irrationality."

    <h2>Act 4-</h2>"Act 4 opens with Herrick removing Tituba and Sarah Good from a jail cell so the court officials can hold a meeting there. Reverend Hale and Reverend Parris are off praying with the other condemned prisoners, which is unsettling to Danforth and Hathorne. When Parris arrives at the meeting, he explains that Hale is trying to get the prisoners to confess to their crimes rather than lose their lives needlessly. He also reveals that Abigail and Mercy Lewis have run away, and they stole his life's savings. The authorities then discuss the state of social unrest that has emerged in Salem after the jailing of so many citizens. Hathorne denies that there is any possibility of rebellion ("Why at every execution I have seen naught but high satisfaction in the town" (pg. 117)), but Parris is very concerned about what will happen if they hang people who are well-respected. Parris has already received a death threat in the form of a dagger wedged in his doorway. He advises that they postpone the hangings and continue pushing for confessions, but Danforth refuses because it would make him look bad. Hale arrives and says that he hasn't extracted any confessions yet. The one prisoner who he hasn't talked to is John Proctor. The officials decide that they will bring in Elizabeth Proctor to speak with him and convince him to confess. Elizabeth and John are left alone, and Elizabeth informs John of Giles Corey's death. Giles was pressed to death with heavy stones since he refused to plead guilty or innocent to the charges of witchcraft. John begs her to tell him whether or not he should confess. He's leaning towards confessing because he doesn't think very much of himself and feels his soul is already beyond redemption. He asks for Elizabeth's forgiveness, but she says her forgiveness doesn't mean anything if he won't forgive himself. She also places some blame on herself for the way things went down with Abigail. She tells him that only he can decide whether or not to confess. John tentatively agrees to confess, but he refuses to name any names and then is reluctant to sign the confession. He decides he can't go through the rest of his life after signing his name into disgrace in this permanent way. He snatches the signed paper away at the last minute and rips it to shreds, thus sealing his fate. Rebecca Nurse and John are then led off to the gallows by Marshal Herrick. The others beg Elizabeth to convince him to reconsider, but she refuses to deprive him of this choice when it's clearly the only way he can break free from his self-hatred."
